# Library for ROI Drawing and Object Counting

This library is a compact tool designed to help users draw Regions of Interest (ROI) and count objects appearing within these areas.

## Key Features:

- Integrates object counting algorithms based on the YOLO model.
- Optimizes the use of YOLO by calling the model only once per frame and reusing the results for multiple ROIs within the same frame.

## Applications:
Useful in tasks like tracking, monitoring, or object counting across fields such as traffic, industry, or agriculture.
